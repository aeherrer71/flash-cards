# Flash-cards

## Description

- This is a card memory game.

## Game Play

- Users click on start and the program displays all cards for approximately 5 seconds.

- After the 5 seconds a countdown clock starts for users to begin matching cards.

- Cards that are a match stay face up. Cards that do not match flip back around to their beginning position.

- Once the time has run out a game over screen appears. The game over screen allows for a new game to be restarted on click

- If a player matches all 16 cards then a victory screen is displayed and the user can restart another game.

- The images are pulled from the Digimon API. A new set of 8 image matches is generated every game.
